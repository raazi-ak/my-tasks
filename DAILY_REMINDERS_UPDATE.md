# 🕐 Daily Reminders System - Updates

## New Daily Reminder Schedule

The app now sends **4 daily reminders** throughout the day (avoiding 1-5 AM) when you have pending tasks:

### 📅 **Reminder Schedule:**

1. **🌅 Morning Check-in** - **9:00 AM**
   - "Good morning! Ready to tackle your pending tasks today?"

2. **☀️ Afternoon Reminder** - **1:00 PM** 
   - "How are your tasks going? Check what's still pending!"

3. **🌆 Evening Review** - **6:00 PM**
   - "Evening check: You have pending tasks to complete!"

4. **🌙 Night Planning** - **10:00 PM**
   - "Before you rest, remember you have tasks for tomorrow!"

## 🎯 **Smart Behavior:**

### ✅ **When Daily Reminders Are Active:**
- Only when you have **pending tasks**
- Only when notifications are **enabled** in settings
- Automatically stops when all tasks are completed

### ✅ **When Daily Reminders Stop:**
- When you complete all your tasks
- When you disable notifications in settings
- No unnecessary notifications when you're caught up!

### ✅ **No More Spam:**
- Daily reminders **don't retrigger** when you toggle notification settings
- Only schedule when tasks are actually added/changed
- Smart scheduling prevents notification overload

## 🚫 **Avoided Time Periods:**

The system specifically avoids the **1:00 AM - 5:00 AM** window to respect your sleep schedule.

## 📱 **User Experience:**

### **Toggling Notifications:**
- **ON:** Reschedules only task-specific reminders
- **OFF:** Cancels all notifications immediately
- **No spam:** Daily reminders only schedule when you actually have work to do

### **Task Management:**
- **Add task:** May trigger daily reminder scheduling if first pending task
- **Complete all tasks:** Automatically cancels daily reminders
- **Delete tasks:** Updates daily reminder schedule accordingly

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// 4 separate daily reminders with unique identifiers
private dailyReminderIdentifiers = [
  'daily-reminder-morning',    // 9 AM
  'daily-reminder-afternoon',  // 1 PM  
  'daily-reminder-evening',    // 6 PM
  'daily-reminder-night'       // 10 PM
];
```

Each reminder has its own:
- Unique identifier for proper cancellation
- Custom message for that time of day
- Automatic rescheduling for next day

## 🎉 **Benefits:**

1. **Better Coverage** - 4 gentle reminders throughout active hours
2. **Sleep Friendly** - No notifications during 1-5 AM
3. **Context Aware** - Different messages for different times of day
4. **No Spam** - Only when you actually have pending work
5. **Smart Toggling** - Notification settings don't trigger unwanted reminders

The daily reminder system now provides helpful, well-timed check-ins without being overwhelming or disruptive to your daily routine!
