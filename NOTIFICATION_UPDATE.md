# 🔔 Notification System - Message Updates

## Updated Notification Messages

The notification system now has more specific and user-friendly messages:

### 1. **Task Reminder Notifications** ⏰
**When:** 1 hour before a specific task's due time
```
Title: "📋 Reminder: [Task Name]"
Body: "This task is due in 1 hour. Don't forget to complete it!"
```
**Example:**
- Title: "📋 Reminder: Finish project proposal"
- Body: "This task is due in 1 hour. Don't forget to complete it!"

### 2. **Daily Pending Tasks Reminder** 🌅
**When:** Every day at 9 AM (if you have pending tasks)
```
Title: "🌅 Good Morning!"
Body: "You have pending tasks waiting for your attention. Ready to tackle them today?"
```

### 3. **Overdue Tasks Alert** ⚠️
**When:** 5 minutes after app detects overdue tasks
```
Title: "⚠️ Tasks Overdue"
Body: "You have [X] overdue task(s) that need attention."
```
**Examples:**
- "You have 1 overdue task that needs attention."
- "You have 3 overdue tasks that need attention."

### 4. **Task Completion Celebration** 🎉
**When:** Immediately when you complete a task
```
Title: "🎉 Well Done!"
Body: "You completed '[Task Name]'! Keep up the great work!"
```
**Example:**
- Title: "🎉 Well Done!"
- Body: "You completed 'Buy groceries'! Keep up the great work!"

## Key Improvements Made:

1. **Specific Task Names** - Reminder notifications now show exactly which task they're for
2. **Clear Context** - Each notification type has distinct messaging
3. **Encouraging Tone** - More motivational and positive language
4. **Better Timing Info** - Clear indication of when tasks are due
5. **Proper Grammar** - Correct pluralization for multiple tasks

## How the System Works:

### Task-Specific Reminders:
- Each task gets its own unique reminder notification
- Shows the exact task title in the notification
- Provides context about when it's due
- Only appears if user enabled reminders for that task

### General Pending Tasks:
- Daily notification at 9 AM if ANY tasks are pending
- Doesn't list specific tasks (to avoid notification overload)
- Encourages checking the app to see what needs to be done
- Only appears if notifications are enabled AND there are pending tasks

The system now provides clear, actionable notifications that help users stay on top of their tasks without being overwhelming!
